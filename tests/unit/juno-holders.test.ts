/**
 * The Holders tab was permanently empty.
 *
 * `getTokenLargestAccounts` is one of the calls the public devnet endpoint
 * refuses by method rather than by rate, so the only path to a holder list
 * never returned anything and a tab a judge clicks showed "could not read"
 * every single time. Every buy and sell against the pool is already decoded
 * from its vault deltas and carries the wallet that signed it, which is enough
 * to rebuild a net position per wallet without that call.
 *
 * What it cannot see is a transfer, so the figures here are "position taken on
 * this pool", not "tokens owned" — the UI says so, and these tests pin the
 * arithmetic that claim rests on.
