/**
 * Who is actually good at this.
 *
 * Every fill on every Juno pool is already decoded from vault deltas, and every
 * fill carries the wallet that signed it. Grouping those by trader and running
 * the same average-cost basis the portfolio uses turns a list of transactions
 * into a ranking — with no indexer, no new table, and no number that was not
 * read from the chain.
 *
 * ## What is being ranked, precisely
 *
 * **Realised** profit only: quote received on a sell minus the average cost of
 * the tokens sold. Unrealised gains are deliberately excluded from the rank.
 * A wallet that bought and never sold has taken no risk off the table, and a
 * leaderboard that counts paper gains ranks whoever bought earliest rather
 * than whoever traded well. Unrealised is reported beside the rank so the
 * picture is complete, but it does not decide the order.
 *
 * ## What this cannot see
 *
 * Only fills inside the walked history window. A wallet whose buys predate it
 * shows a sell with no matching cost, and `basisFromSwaps` correctly refuses to
 * invent one — those proceeds are skipped rather than counted as pure profit.
 * `partial` says when that happened, and the route passes it through, because
 * a leaderboard that quietly omits half the trades is worse than one that says
 * it is short.
