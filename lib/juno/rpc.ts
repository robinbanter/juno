/**
 * Surviving a public RPC endpoint.
 *
 * Juno runs against `api.devnet.solana.com` with no API key, which rate-limits
 * a burst hard enough to break a demo. `getConnection()` sets
 * `disableRetryOnRateLimit` on purpose — web3.js's own retry logs a wall of
 * noise and costs eight seconds — so retrying is this module's job instead,
 * with a budget the caller chooses.
 *
 * Two rules learned the hard way:
 *
 * Only retry what retrying can fix. A 429 or a 503 is a "come back later"; a
 * malformed request or a missing account is not, and hammering it wastes the
 * exact budget the real failure needs.
 *
 * Never let one failed page discard the pages that succeeded. A partial answer
 * from a rate-limited endpoint is worth more than an empty one, provided the
 * caller can tell the difference — which is why `collect` reports both.
