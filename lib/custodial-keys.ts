/**
 * Versioned encryption keys for custodial wallet secrets.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT marked "server-only": the ops scripts (`keys:rotate`) need
 * the exact same key handling as the app, and a second copy of this logic is how
 * you get two subtly different implementations of the thing guarding users'
 * money. It stays safe because it only reads non-NEXT_PUBLIC env vars, which are
 * simply absent in a browser — an accidental client import throws rather than
 * leaking. Callers that touch the database still carry the guard themselves.
 *
 * The problem this solves: with a single unversioned secret, rotating
 * CUSTODIAL_KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET is impossible. You can't tell which rows were
 * sealed with which key, so a leaked secret can never be retired — you'd have to
 * re-encrypt every wallet in one atomic step and hope nothing fails halfway. For
 * data that IS users' money, "we can never rotate this" is not an acceptable
 * resting state.
 *
 * So each wallet records the key version it was sealed with, and several
 * versions can be readable at once. Rotation becomes: add a new version, make it
 * current, re-encrypt rows in the background (`npm run keys:rotate`), then drop
 * the old secret once nothing references it.
 *
 * Env:
 *   CUSTODIAL_KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET      version 1 (the original; still honoured)
 *   CUSTODIAL_KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET_V2   version 2, and so on
 *   CUSTODIAL_KEY_VERSION                which version to seal NEW data with
