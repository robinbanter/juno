/**
 * Juno's theme — neon lime on sage.
 *
 * Sage canvas, near-white cards, and one electric lime that carries every
 * primary action. A trading app usually reaches for dark; this deliberately
 * does not, because the point of Juno is that a market is a social object and
 * the feed should feel like somewhere people post rather than a terminal.
 *
 * ## The lime always carries dark ink
 *
 * Measured, not assumed: `#D6FF3D` against `#12150E` is **16.00:1**, and
 * against white it is **1.15:1** — unusable. So `onLime` is ink and there is
 * no white-on-lime variant to reach for by mistake.
 *
 * ## Direction colours were re-picked, not carried over
 *
 * `pos`/`neg` pass all six palette checks against the card surface, including
 * deuteranopia separation at ΔE 9.0. That is above the safe floor but not
 * comfortably clear of it, so direction is always spelled out in text beside
 * the arrow — colour is never the only thing saying which way a price moved.
