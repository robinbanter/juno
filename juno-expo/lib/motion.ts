/**
 * Juno's motion constants, in one place so the app moves as one thing.
 *
 * The numbers are not taste alone. Three rules decide almost all of them:
 *
 * **Entering and exiting use ease-out.** It starts fast, so the first frame the
 * eye is watching already shows movement. `ease-in` at the same duration
 * *feels* slower because it withholds exactly the frames someone is looking at.
 *
 * **Exit is faster than enter.** Opening is the user deciding; closing is the
 * system getting out of the way. A sheet that takes as long to leave as it took
 * to arrive feels like it is arguing.
 *
 * **Under 300ms, except the sheet.** A drawer crossing most of the screen has
 * further to travel and reads as sluggish if it is rushed, so it gets a spring
 * rather than a longer duration — and a spring can be caught mid-flight by a
 * finger, which is the whole point on a surface people drag.
 *
 * There is no list-entrance constant here on purpose. A staggered cascade on a
 * feed shipped briefly and was wrong: this app's surfaces are for completing a
 * task, the feed can take fifteen seconds to read, and choreography on top of
 * that is asking someone to watch it load. The skeletons say "loading"; the
 * rows arrive. Motion in this app conveys state — a press, a sheet, a glyph
 * turning — and nothing else.
