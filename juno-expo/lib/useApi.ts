 * One async read, with the three states a screen actually has to draw.

 * Deliberately not react-query. This app makes a handful of calls from a
 * handful of screens, and a cache library would be more configuration than the
 * problem has — while still leaving the same three states to render.
 *
 * `refreshing` is separate from `loading` because they mean different things on
 * screen. A first load has nothing to show and gets a skeleton; a pull to
 * refresh already has content, and replacing it with a skeleton throws away
 * what the user was reading and makes the app feel like it lost its place.
