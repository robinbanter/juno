/**
 * One coin: what it is, what it costs, and how to trade it.
 *
 * ## Why the chart is the whole top of the screen
 *
 * Every other arrangement of this page buried the price in a card among other
 * cards, which is a claim that the price is one fact of several. It is not —
 * it is the reason anyone opened the screen. So it is edge to edge, with no
 * container around it, and everything else is arranged underneath in the order
 * the questions actually get asked: *what is this*, *how big is it*, *who else
 * is here*, *what are the details*.
 *
 * ## Why the rest is tabbed rather than stacked
 *
 * Activity, holders, comments and metadata are four answers to four different
 * questions, and only one is wanted at a time. Stacked, they made the page
 * thousands of points long and pushed the buy button off the bottom of it;
 * tabbed, the action bar is always in reach and the page never changes height
 * when a slow read lands.
 *
 * ## The NAV band and the savings card
 *
 * Both live under **Details**, because that is what they are: facts about this
 * instrument rather than about its market. The watch toggle stays in the nav
 * bar, where it is one tap from anywhere on the page.
