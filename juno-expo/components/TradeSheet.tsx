/**
 * Buy and sell, with a numpad.
 *
 * A system keyboard is the wrong control here. It covers half the screen —
 * including the quote the person is deciding on — offers characters an amount
 * cannot contain, and moves its decimal key by locale. A purpose-built pad
 * keeps the number, the quote and the button visible at once, which is the
 * whole decision in one view.
 *
 * ## The quote is fetched, not computed
 *
 * The amount could be multiplied by the last price, and that estimate would be
 * wrong in exactly the way that matters: a bonding curve moves as it fills, so
 * a large order does not clear at spot. The server quotes against the live
 * curve and returns the transaction built against that same quote, so what is
 * shown is what gets signed.
 *
 * Debounced, because a quote is an RPC round trip and typing "125" should not
 * cost three of them.
 *
 * ## Saying so afterwards
 *
 * Juno is a social app and a trade was the one thing you could not talk about:
 * the comment box here attaches your words to the fill, with the side and the
 * signature on the row. That is what makes it an announcement rather than a
 * boast — anyone reading it can check it on an explorer.
 *
 * Posted only after the signature lands, and a failure to post says so without
 * pretending the trade failed. The two are different events and only one of
 * them moved money.
