/**
 * The scale-down that tells a finger the interface heard it.
 *
 * Nothing in this app had it. A card that does not move under a thumb reads as
 * a picture of a card, and on a touch screen there is no hover state to carry
 * the difference — the press *is* the whole conversation.
 *
 * Down is faster than up, and that asymmetry is deliberate: the press is the
 * acknowledgement and wants to be immediate, the release is the system letting
 * go and can afford to settle. Both stay under 200ms, because past that the
 * feedback arrives after the user has already moved on.
 *
 * Reduced motion keeps it. This is feedback, not decoration — removing it would
 * cost information and the movement is a couple of points.
